# Using this template on GitLab

Everything in this repo works on GitLab too — the register mechanics are the same
(issues + labels + a board + method docs); only the platform plumbing differs. This page
is the mapping. GitHub artifacts live under `.github/` + `scripts/setup-*.sh` (gh CLI);
their GitLab counterparts live under `.gitlab/` + `scripts/*-gitlab.sh` (glab CLI) +
`.gitlab-ci.yml`. Verified against GitLab 17.x docs; tier caveats are marked. The **Free
tier runs the whole base workflow** (issues, labels, project boards, the templates, the
CI jobs) — a few *conveniences* are Premium/Ultimate and have a Free fallback noted
inline: scoped-label exclusivity **enforcement** (§ Labels), issue **weight** for Score
(table), and code-owner-approval **enforcement**. None of those block the register.

## Equivalence table

| Concern | GitHub | GitLab |
|---|---|---|
| Get the template | *Use this template* / `gh repo create --template` | no template button: **Import project → Repository by URL** (or `git clone --mirror` + push); GitLab groups can also mark a project as a [custom project template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/custom_project_templates.html) (Premium) |
| Raising a risk | issue **form** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/risk.yml` | **description template** [`.gitlab/issue_templates/Risk.md`](../.gitlab/issue_templates/Risk.md) — markdown sections instead of form fields; the embedded [quick actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html) (`/label …`) auto-apply the labels on creation |
| Harm risk (ISO 14971) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/harm-risk.yml` | [`.gitlab/issue_templates/Harm Risk.md`](../.gitlab/issue_templates/Harm%20Risk.md) |
| Requirement (traceability anchor) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/requirement.yml` | [`.gitlab/issue_templates/Requirement.md`](../.gitlab/issue_templates/Requirement.md) |
| SOUP anomaly (62304 §7.1.3 record) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/soup-anomaly.yml` | [`.gitlab/issue_templates/SOUP Anomaly.md`](../.gitlab/issue_templates/SOUP%20Anomaly.md) |
| Field feedback / incident (14971 §10 intake) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/field-feedback.yml` | [`.gitlab/issue_templates/Field Feedback.md`](../.gitlab/issue_templates/Field%20Feedback.md) |
| CI-generator updates (ADR-0003) | Dependabot ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml), github-actions ecosystem) | Renovate ([`renovate.json`](../renovate.json), `gitlabci` manager — bumps the Syft/Trivy image pins; inert until the Renovate app/runner is enabled) |
| Labels | flat names with `:` (e.g. `risk:open`), created by `scripts/setup-labels.sh` (gh) | **scoped labels** `risk::open` etc., created by [`scripts/setup-labels-gitlab.sh`](../scripts/setup-labels-gitlab.sh) (glab) — the script maps `x:y` → `x::y`. On **Premium/Ultimate** scoped labels are mutually exclusive per scope, which *enforces* the lifecycle/severity single-value rule; on **Free** they are ordinary labels and the rule stays a manual convention (exactly as on GitHub) — the register works either way |
| Score | Projects v2 number field | Score = L×I, recorded on the issue at triage. **Free:** in the issue description (the Risk template captures L and I) or a colon-free `score-<n>` label. **Premium/Ultimate:** the numeric issue **weight** (`/weight <n>`), which sorts/filters natively |
| Board | Projects v2 board + custom fields (`scripts/setup-project-board.sh`) | **issue board** with label lists per lifecycle label ([`scripts/setup-boards-gitlab.sh`](../scripts/setup-boards-gitlab.sh)). **Multiple *project* boards are Free** (since 12.1), so run one combined board (delivery + harm lists side by side) or split into separate *Risk Register* / *Harm Risk File* boards — all on Free. (Only *group*-level boards are capped at one on Free; configurable/saved board *scopes* are Premium.) |
| Matrix/severity views | Projects v2 views (manual recipe) | board filtered by `risk-sev::*` labels, or the issue list grouped by label; save as [board scopes] on Premium |
| PR template + gate | `.github/pull_request_template.md` | [`.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md`](../.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md) |
| CODEOWNERS | `.github/CODEOWNERS` | [`.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`](../.gitlab/CODEOWNERS) (GitLab reads root, `docs/`, or `.gitlab/` — **not** `.github/`); enforcement via protected-branch "Code owner approval" (Premium) |
| CI: SBOM per release | `.github/workflows/sbom.yml` (release asset) | `sbom` job in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../.gitlab-ci.yml) — Syft, CycloneDX, runs on tags (job artifact; attach to a release with `release-cli` if you use GitLab releases) |
| CI: per-release register export (14971 §9 evidence) | `.github/workflows/register-export.yml` (release asset, default token) | `register-export` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` on tags — **skips itself** without `RISK_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` (CI_JOB_TOKEN cannot list issues) |
| CI: compiled Risk Management File (14971 §4.5/§9 deliverable) | `.github/workflows/risk-management-file.yml` — attaches PDF/DOCX to the release + PRs the Markdown master (ADR-0004) | `risk-management-file` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` on tags (`pandoc/latex` image) — same `scripts/build-risk-management-file.py`; consumes `register-export`'s JSON when present; output as job artifacts (attach to a GitLab release via `release-cli`) |
| CI: vulnerability → register | Dependabot alerts → `risk-automation.yml` | guarded `vuln-to-register` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`: scheduled Trivy scan opens deduped `risk` + `risk-cat::vulnerability` issues. **Inert until** `RISK_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=1` **and** `RISK_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` (project access token with `api` scope) are set — the same inert-until-configured contract as the GitHub workflow. (GitLab's built-in Dependency Scanning is Ultimate; the Trivy job is the tier-independent equivalent) |
| Auto-add to board | Projects v2 auto-add workflow | not needed: label lists pull labelled issues onto the board automatically |

## Setup on GitLab (mirrors the README's GitHub steps)

```bash
# 0. Import the template (GitLab has no template button)
#    GitLab UI: New project → Import project → Repository by URL → this repo's URL
#    or, keeping full history, from a local clone:
git clone --mirror <this-repo-url> rmt.git && cd rmt.git
git push --mirror git@<your-gitlab-host>:<group>/<name>.git

# 1. Labels (scoped; idempotent; needs glab authenticated against your instance)
./scripts/setup-labels-gitlab.sh <group>/<name>
./scripts/setup-labels-gitlab.sh <group>/<name> .github/conformance-labels.json

# 2. Board lists (label lists on the default board; idempotent)
./scripts/setup-boards-gitlab.sh <group>/<name>

# 3. Templates are picked up automatically from .gitlab/ (issue + MR templates).
# 4. Optional automation: set CI/CD variables RISK_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=1 and
#    RISK_AUTOMATION_TOKEN (project access token, api scope) + a pipeline schedule.
```

## Label-name mapping (canonical ↔ GitLab)

The method docs use the canonical flat names (`risk:open`); on GitLab they materialize as
scoped labels (`risk::open`). Both spellings mean the same state — when a doc says "apply
`risk-sev:high`", on GitLab that is `risk-sev::high`. Plain labels without a colon
(`risk`, `harm-risk`, `requirement`, `soup-anomaly`, `disclose-in-ifu`, `field-feedback`)
are identical on both platforms.
Note the deliberate split: severity is `risk-sev:*` (→ `risk-sev::*`), a **separate scope**
from the lifecycle `risk:*` (→ `risk::*`), so that on Premium a severity label and a
lifecycle label coexist instead of evicting each other under one `risk::` scope — do not
merge them back into `risk:sev-*`.
One caveat: scoped labels — their mutual-exclusivity **semantics** and their two-tone
chip display alike — are a **Premium/Ultimate** feature on *all* GitLab instances
(GitLab.com, self-managed, and Dedicated); there is no Free-tier exception. On **Free**,
`risk::open` etc. are created and behave as ordinary plain labels with **no** exclusivity
enforcement — the single-value lifecycle/severity rule is then a manual convention you
uphold by hand (remove the old value when you add the new one), exactly as the GitHub
flavor already documents. The register is unaffected; only the automatic
one-value-per-scope guard is the paid upgrade.

## What stays identical

The method is platform-free: `docs/RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`, `docs/HARM_RISK.md`, the 5×5
scoring, the conformance layer (`docs/standards/`, ADRs, SOUP/`soup.yaml`,
`docs/TRACEABILITY.md`, arc42) and `RISKS.md` need no changes. `scripts/traceability-matrix.sh`
is gh-based; on GitLab use the MR list per requirement label (`glab mr list --label requirement`)
or adapt the script — noted in `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`.
