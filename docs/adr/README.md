# Architecture Decision Records

MADR-style ADRs ([template](TEMPLATE.md)); one file per decision, numbered
`NNNN-kebab-title.md`, never renumbered, superseded instead of deleted. Decisions belong
here when they are important, expensive, large-scale, or risky — the [arc42
§9](../arc42/09_architecture_decisions.md) criterion.

Risk linkage (see [`docs/RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`](../RISK_MANAGEMENT.md) §9): an ADR taken to
reduce a registered risk cites the risk issue in its rationale; the issue links back; the
architecture-level view lives in [arc42 §11](../arc42/11_technical_risks.md).
